This test case demonstrates the need to add lclear label to the 
values obtained through the mailbox (which includes both `peek`
and `consume` operations)

The example is based on the masters thesis by Martin, Kristian, and Emil
on the formalization of Troupe in Coq.

(* I will need two processes *)

let fun f () = 
	let  val c = raisembox (`{bob}`)
	     val x = consume  (0, `{alice}`, `{alice,bob}`) 
	     val _ = debugpc ()
	     val _ = blockdeclto (authority , `{alice}`)
	     val _ = lowermbox (c, authority)
	     val _ = debugpc ()
	     val _ = peek  (0, `{alice}`, `{alice}`)
	     val _ = debugpc ()
	in ladv (`{alice}`, ()) 
	end 
    val p1 = spawn f 
    fun g () = if true raisedTo `{alice}` then 
    			send (p1, "HELLO");
               		send (p1, "BYE")
	        else () 
    val p2 = spawn g 
in (p1, p2)
end
