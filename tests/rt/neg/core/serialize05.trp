Negative test checking the interaction between sandboxing and serialization; 
resumption konts that we receive from the sandbox must not be serializable

This test is a variant of seralize04.trp. Compared to serialize04.trp here 
we wrap the resume kont in a lambda; this should still fail

let fun f() =_debug (1); sleep (2000); _debug (2)
    val (2, resume) = sandbox (1000, f)
in  save ("serialize05", fn () => resume)
end
