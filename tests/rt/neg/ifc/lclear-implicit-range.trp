(* negative test; this program attempts to receive in a range without 
   sufficient clearance *)

consume (0,`{}`, `{alice}`) 
(* rcv (`{}`, `{alice}`, [hn x => x]) *)

(* 2021-08-08; AA; this test has been modified to use consume 
   instead of the rcv because rcv is now a service library code 
   and because of how it is constructed, consume ends up 
   being called in the high pc
